# Rust Playground

Welcome to the Rust Playground! This is a space where I experiment with the Rust language features, test ideas, and explore different crates available on crates.io. Below, are some resources used in this playground.

## Dependencies

- [SQLite Database](https://crates.io/crates/sqlite): A crate for working with SQLite databases in Rust.


## Resources

- [SQLite Docs](https://docs.rs/sqlite/0.36.0/sqlite/): Official documentation for the SQLite crate.
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html): Rust tutorials with examples.
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html): Comprehensive guide to learning Rust.

## Projects

### SQL store

[SQL Store]() is a simple task management application that uses SQLite for storage. 
It allows you to add, list, delete, read, and update tasks.

#### Features:

- Add new tasks with titles and statuses.
- List all tasks stored in the database.
- Delete tasks from the database.
- Read details of a specific task.
