# Projects

- [x] [SQL Store](https://github.com/kevinchrist20/rust_playground/tree/master/sql_store) is a simple task management application that uses SQLite for storage. It allows you to add, list, delete, read, and update tasks.

- [x] [Lyrical](https://github.com/kevinchrist20/rust_playground/tree/master/lyrical) is a simple web scraper that fetches song lyrics from the [Azlyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/) website. It allows you to search for a song by its title and artist name.

- [ ] File Encryption/Decryption Tool: Create a command-line tool that encrypts and decrypts files using popular encryption algorithms like AES. This project will help you understand file I/O and cryptographic libraries in Rust.

- [ ] Markdown to HTML Converter: Develop a program that converts Markdown files to HTML. This project will involve parsing Markdown syntax and generating corresponding HTML output. You can use crates like `pulldown-cmark` for parsing Markdown.

- [ ] Simple HTTP Server: Build a simple HTTP server from scratch to handle basic GET and POST requests. This project will give you hands-on experience with networking and asynchronous programming in Rust. You can use the hyper crate for building the server. Implement routing and response handling. Optionally, add features like middleware, templates, and session management.

- [ ] Password Manager: Create a password manager application that securely stores and manages user passwords. This project will involve encryption, database interaction (you can use SQLite or other databases), and command-line interface design.

- [ ] Todo List Web Application: Develop a simple web application for managing todo lists. Use a web framework like `actix-web` or `Rocket` to build the backend, and a frontend framework like `Yew` or `Seed` for the client-side.

- [ ] Markdown Editor: Build a desktop application for editing Markdown files. This project will involve creating a GUI using a framework like `gtk-rs` or `druid`. You can also add features like live preview of Markdown rendering.

- [ ] Image Processing Tool: Create a program that applies various image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and filters to images. You can use the `image` crate for working with images in Rust.

- [ ] Chat Application: Develop a simple real-time chat application using WebSockets that allows users to communicate in real-time. This project will involve networking, concurrency, and possibly websockets.Implement both the client and server parts. The server could be in Rust using frameworks like `warp` or `actix-web`. The client could be a web application using JavaScript or a desktop application using `gtk-rs`, `druid`, `slint`, `tauri`, or `iced` or terminal-based using `crossterm`.

- [ ] Code Snippet Manager: Build a command-line tool for storing and organizing code snippets. This project will involve working with files, command-line arguments, and possibly a database for storing snippets.

- [ ] REST API Server: Create a RESTful API server using Rust. You can use the `actix-web` or `Rocket` framework for building the server and interact with a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL with `diesel` or `sqlx`.

- [ ] CLI Tool for File Operations: Create a command-line tool that can perform various file operations like copy, move, delete, and search. Add support for recursive directory operations and file pattern matching.
  
- [ ] Game Development: Develop a simple game using the `ggez` or `bevy` game engine. Start with something basic like Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake, or a basic platformer.

- [ ] Compiler or Interpreter: Write a simple compiler or interpreter for a toy programming language. Focus on parsing, abstract syntax trees, and code generation or interpretation.

- [ ] Concurrency and Parallelism: Develop an application that makes heavy use of concurrency and parallelism, such as a multi-threaded web crawler or a concurrent task scheduler. Use Rust's concurrency primitives like `async/await`, `tokio`, or `rayon`.

- [ ] Cryptography Toolkit:Create a library that implements basic cryptographic operations like hashing, encryption, and decryption. Use Rust’s strong type system to ensure safety and correctness in cryptographic operations.

- [ ] Machine Learning Library: Build a simple machine learning library in Rust that implements common algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering, and decision trees. Use crates like `ndarray` for numerical computations.

- [ ] Data Analysis Tool: Develop a tool to perform data analysis and visualization. Use crates like `polars` for data manipulation and `plotters` for generating visualizations.

- [ ] IoT Device Control: Build software to control and monitor IoT devices. Interface with hardware components, read sensor data, and send commands to actuators using Rust’s embedded systems ecosystem.
  
- [ ] Command-Line Shell: Create a custom command-line shell with features like command history, tab completion, and scripting support. You can use the `rustyline` crate for building interactive shells.

- [ ] Real-time Data Stream Processor: Create an application that processes real-time data streams. Use crates like kafka-rust to consume and produce messages from/to Apache Kafka.
