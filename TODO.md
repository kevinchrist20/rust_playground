# Projects

- [x] [SQL Store](https://github.com/kevinchrist20/rust_playground/tree/master/sql_store) is a simple task management application that uses SQLite for storage. It allows you to add, list, delete, read, and update tasks.

- [x] [Lyrical](https://github.com/kevinchrist20/rust_playground/tree/master/lyrical) is a simple web scraper that fetches song lyrics from the [Azlyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/) website. It allows you to search for a song by its title and artist name. 

- [ ] File Encryption/Decryption Tool: Create a command-line tool that encrypts and decrypts files using popular encryption algorithms like AES. This project will help you understand file I/O and cryptographic libraries in Rust.

- [ ] Markdown to HTML Converter: Develop a program that converts Markdown files to HTML. This project will involve parsing Markdown syntax and generating corresponding HTML output. You can use crates like pulldown-cmark for parsing Markdown.

- [ ] Simple HTTP Server: Build a basic HTTP server that can handle GET and POST requests. This project will give you hands-on experience with networking and asynchronous programming in Rust. You can use the hyper crate for building the server.

- [ ] Password Manager: Create a password manager application that securely stores and manages user passwords. This project will involve encryption, database interaction (you can use SQLite or other databases), and command-line interface design.

- [ ] Todo List Web Application: Develop a simple web application for managing todo lists. Use a web framework like actix-web or Rocket to build the backend, and a frontend framework like Yew or Seed for the client-side.

- [ ] Markdown Editor: Build a desktop application for editing Markdown files. This project will involve creating a GUI using a framework like gtk-rs or druid. You can also add features like live preview of Markdown rendering.

- [ ] Image Processing Tool: Create a program that applies various image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and filters to images. You can use the image crate for working with images in Rust.

- [ ] Chat Application: Develop a simple chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time. This project will involve networking, concurrency, and possibly websockets. You can use the tokio crate for asynchronous programming.

- [ ] Code Snippet Manager: Build a command-line tool for storing and organizing code snippets. This project will involve working with files, command-line arguments, and possibly a database for storing snippets.

- [ ] REST API Server: Create a RESTful API server using Rust. You can use the actix-web or Rocket framework for building the server and interact with a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL.
